Even though the extension is already quite functional, there are many
things to improve:


    - Automatic test suite.

    - Ports to as many OS as possible.

    - Whatever you suggest.


I specially need help about porting, I guess it should work wherever Tcl and
cURL are already present, I would be grateful for any feedback about where 
it does or doesn't work.
